                        <p>
                            Madonna was one of the earlier projects I worked on, it was a website rebuild for an engineering company. Most of the site is just html and css with a few small modals and the map set up using js.

                        <li>Google Map, I was in charge of rendering and stylizing the map for the main and contact page</li>
                        <li>The projects page, was actually designed and coded by me, I use a set of modal drawers when in mobile to handle the surplus of information.</li>

                            A fun side project I built that generates lorem ipsum, the catch is all the paragraphs are Xzibit jokes or references to old xzibit lyrics

                        <li>The project heavily relies on js string concatination, to create one paragaraph at a time before outputting it</li>
                        <li>the project also has hidden textarea it populates at the same time then uses to copy the text to the clipboard</li>

                        <p>
                            Training Places is a lead generation  website created with the Django web framework by my employer  to collect information from students looking to apply for programs and courses across canada/

                        <li>Form Hiding, I wrote a program that stores cookies from users and hides forms if a user has already applied to the school in the past and reveals the form in question if the user clicks a button, I also use a similar funtion to pre-populate the forms on the site with user data</li>
                        <li>Phone Masking, to help prevent users from submitting inaccurate phone information I created a phone mask that filters out letters and prevents uneccesary extra digits like a "1's" at the beginning</li>
                        <li>Automated email system, I wrote a python script that combs through leads and emails a suggested course to applicants if they havent already applied to something similar</li>

                            This is a site rebuild that is about to be launched, it is also built using django and is supposed to be used to sell building units for property owners.

                        <li>I built out the majority of the front-end of this site as well a number of apps that run on it, this includes that blogging app, the property search app, contact page, and home page </li>
                        <li>The search function is one of the most complicated parts of the site, it receives a list of properties from django and renders map points as well as information cards on the front end, when  a user fills out the form and updates what they are looking for, the form sends a get request and the page updates with relevant properties for the user</li>
                        <li>The Blog is a much simpler app that just lists articles and allows one to sort by topic and share articles</li>
